# solar-model

A Solar system planetary motion simulation project in Java.

#### Prerequisites:
 - Java - to run the code;
 - VMD - to visualise the solar system. You can download VMD from [here](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). 

#### Running the code:

 - Compile ParticleManyBody, Particle3D and Vector3D
 - Run "java ParticleManyBody particle.input param.input traj.xyz"

#### Config files:

 - particle.input contains positions and velocities of Solar system objects, taken from [NASA/JPL HORIZONS system](http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi). 2016-03-05 snapshot of the Solar system was used to make this file.
 - param.input contains the number of iterations, timestep length in Earth days and the gravitational constant in units of AU^2^ E~mass~^-1^ E~day~^-2^ units. The file contains "365, 1, 8.89e-10" by default.

#### Visualising the system:
If you have VMD installed, you can run "vmd traj.xyz" to visualise and animate the solar system. Be sure to change the drawing method to "Points" by clicking Graphics -> Representations... -> Draw Style -> Drawing Method and increase the size until you can see the points. The simulation can be played by clicking the â–¶ button on the VMD Main window.

You can also see the orbits of planets by typing in a range (e.g. 0:365) at Graphics -> Representations... -> Trajectory -> Draw Multiple Frames and pressing enter.
